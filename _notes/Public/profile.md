# Interests
## Main Interests
- I'm mainly interested in **AI**, **Data Science**, **Mathematics** and **Philosophy**.
- I like to learn about **AI** in terms of each Computer Science, Statistics(Mathematics more broadly) and neuroscience. My main field in AI is NLP, but also interested in CV and other fields.
- I also like **Data Science**, especially Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA). Studying knowledges and discovering new insights with EDA or by combining Data Science and AI is delightful.
- In fields of **Philosophy**, I have been focusing on **Epistemology**, and it is still my main interest. But due to the influence of my friend and one of my professor, I also became interested in Oriental Philosophy and other Philosophy fields such as Ethics and Social Philosophy.
